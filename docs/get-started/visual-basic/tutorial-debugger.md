# Tutorial: Learn to debug Visual Basic code using Visual Studio

This article introduces the features of the Visual Studio debugger in a step-by-step walkthrough. If you want a higher-level view of the debugger features, see [First look at the debugger](../../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md). When you *debug your app*, it usually means that you are running your application with the debugger attached. When you do this, the debugger provides many ways to see what your code is doing while it runs. You can step through your code and look at the values stored in variables, you can set watches on variables to see when values change, you can examine the execution path of your code, see whether a branch of code is running, and so on. If this is the first time that you've tried to debug code, you may want to read [Debugging for absolute beginners](../../debugger/debugging-absolute-beginners.md) before going through this article.

In this tutorial, you will:

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

You must have Visual Studio 2019 installed and the **.NET desktop development** workload.

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="vs-2017"

You must have Visual Studio 2017 installed and the **.NET desktop development** workload.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=vs+2017+download) page to install it for free.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

If you haven't already installed Visual Studio, go to the [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) page to install it for free.

::: moniker-end

If you need to install the workload but already have Visual Studio, go to **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**, which opens the Visual Studio Installer. The Visual Studio Installer launches. Choose the **.NET desktop development** workload, then choose **Modify**.

## Create a project

1. Open Visual Studio.

    ::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"
    Press **Esc** to close the start window. Type **Ctrl + Q** to open the search box, type **visual basic**, choose **Templates**, then choose **Create new Console App (.NET Framework) project**. In the dialog box that appears, type a name like **get-started-debugging**, and then choose **Create**.
    ::: moniker-end
    ::: moniker range="vs-2017"
    From the top menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project**. In the left pane of the **New project** dialog box, under **Visual Basic**, choose **Windows Desktop**, and then in the middle pane choose **Console App (.NET Framework)**. Then, type a name like **get-started-debugging** and click **OK**.
    ::: moniker-end

    If you don't see the **Console App (.NET Framework)** project template, go to **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features...**, which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Choose the **.NET desktop development** workload, then choose **Modify**.

    Visual Studio creates the project.

1. In *Module1.vb*, replace the following code

    ```vb
    Module Module1

        Sub Main()
        End Sub

    End Module
    ```

    with this code:

    ```vb
    Imports System
    Imports System.Collections.Generic

    Public Class Shape

      ' A few example members
        Public Property X As Integer
            Get
                Return X
            End Get
            Set
            End Set
        End Property

        Public Property Y As Integer
            Get
                Return Y
            End Get
            Set
            End Set
        End Property

        Public Property Height As Integer
            Get
                Return Height
            End Get
            Set
            End Set
        End Property

        Public Property Width As Integer
            Get
                Return Width
            End Get
            Set
            End Set
        End Property

        ' Virtual method
        Public Overridable Sub Draw()
            Console.WriteLine("Performing base class drawing tasks")
        End Sub
    End Class

    Public Class Circle
        Inherits Shape

        Public Overrides Sub Draw()
            ' Code to draw a circle...
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle")
            MyBase.Draw()
        End Sub
    End Class

    Public Class Rectangle
        Inherits Shape

        Public Overrides Sub Draw()
            ' Code to draw a rectangle...
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle")
            MyBase.Draw()
        End Sub
    End Class

    Public Class Triangle
        Inherits Shape

        Public Overrides Sub Draw()
            ' Code to draw a triangle...
            Console.WriteLine("Drawing a trangle")
            MyBase.Draw()
        End Sub
    End Class

    Module Module1

        Sub Main(ByVal args() As String)

            Dim shapes = New List(Of Shape) From
            {
                New Rectangle,
                New Triangle,
                New Circle
            }

            For Each shape In shapes
                shape.Draw()
            Next
            ' Keep the console open in debug mode.
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.")
            Console.ReadKey()

        End Sub

    End Module

    ' Output:
    '    Drawing a rectangle
    '    Performing base class drawing tasks
    '    Drawing a triangle
    '    Performing base class drawing tasks
    '    Drawing a circle
    '    Performing base class drawing tasks
    ```

## Start the debugger!

1. Press **F5** (**Debug > Start Debugging**) or the **Start Debugging** button ![Start Debugging](../../debugger/media/dbg-tour-start-debugging.png "Start Debugging") in the Debug Toolbar.

     **F5** starts the app with the debugger attached to the app process, but right now we haven't done anything special to examine the code. So the app just loads and you see the console output.

    ```cmd
    Drawing a rectangle
    Performing base class drawing tasks
    Drawing a triangle
    Performing base class drawing tasks
    Drawing a circle
    Performing base class drawing tasks
    ```

     In this tutorial, we'll take a closer look at this app using the debugger and get a look at the debugger features.

2. Stop the debugger by pressing the red stop ![Stop Debugging](../../debugger/media/dbg-tour-stop-debugging.png "Stop Debugging") button.

## Set a breakpoint and start the debugger

1. In the `For Each` loop of the `Main` function, set a breakpoint by clicking the left margin of the following line of code:

    `shape.Draw()`

    A red circle appears where you set the breakpoint.

    ![Set a breakpoint](../visual-basic/media/get-started-set-breakpoint-vb.png)

    Breakpoints are the most basic and essential feature of reliable debugging. A breakpoint indicates where Visual Studio should suspend your running code so you can take a look at the values of variables, or the behavior of memory, or whether or not a branch of code is getting run.

2. Press **F5** or the **Start Debugging** button ![Start Debugging](../../debugger/media/dbg-tour-start-debugging.png "Start Debugging"), the app starts, and the debugger runs to the line of code where you set the breakpoint.

    ![Hit a breakpoint](../visual-basic/media/get-started-hit-breakpoint-vb.png)

    The yellow arrow represents the statement on which the debugger paused, which also suspends app execution at the same point (this statement has not yet executed).

     If the app is not yet running, **F5** starts the debugger and stops at the first breakpoint. Otherwise, **F5** continues running the app to the next breakpoint.

    Breakpoints are a useful feature when you know the line of code or the section of code that you want to examine in detail.

## Navigate code in the debugger using step commands

Mostly, we use the keyboard shortcuts here, because it's a good way to get fast at executing your app in the debugger (equivalent commands such as menu commands are shown in parentheses).

1. While paused in the `shape.Draw` method call in the `Main` function, press **F11** (or choose **Debug > Step Into**) to advance into code for the `Rectangle` class.

     ![Use F11 to Step Into code](../visual-basic/media/get-started-f11-vb.png "F11 Step Into")

     F11 is the **Step Into** command and advances the app execution one statement at a time. F11 is a good way to examine the execution flow in the most detail. (To move faster through code, we show you some other options also.) By default, the debugger skips over non-user code (if you want more details, see [Just My Code](../../debugger/just-my-code.md)).

2. Press **F10** (or choose **Debug > Step Over**) a few times until the debugger stops on the `MyBase.Draw` method call, and then press **F10** one more time.

     ![Use F10 to Step Over code](../visual-basic/media/get-started-step-over-vb.png "F10 Step Over")

     Notice this time that the debugger does not step into the `Draw` method of the base class (`Shape`). **F10** advances the debugger without stepping into functions or methods in your app code (the code still executes). By pressing **F10** on the `MyBase.Draw` method call (instead of **F11**), we skipped over the implementation code for `MyBase.Draw` (which maybe we're not interested in right now).

## Navigate code using Run to Click

1. In the code editor, scroll down and hover over the `Console.WriteLine` method in the `Triangle` class until the green **Run to Click** button ![Run to Click](../../debugger/media/dbg-tour-run-to-click.png "RunToClick") appears on the left. The tooltip for the button shows "Run execution to here".

     ![Use the Run to Click feature](../visual-basic/media/get-started-run-to-click-vb.png "Run to Click")

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Run to Click** button is new in [!include[vs_dev15](../../misc/includes/vs_dev15_md.md)]. If you don't see the green arrow button, use **F11** in this example instead to advance the debugger to the right place.

2. Click the **Run to Click** button ![Run to Click](../../debugger/media/dbg-tour-run-to-click.png "RunToClick").

    Using this button is similar to setting a temporary breakpoint. **Run to Click** is handy for getting around quickly within a visible region of app code (you can click in any open file).

    The debugger advances to the `Console.WriteLine` method implementation for the `Triangle` class.

    While paused, you notice a typo! The output "Drawing a trangle" is misspelled. We can fix it right here while running the app in the debugger.

## Edit code and continue debugging

1. Click into "Drawing a trangle" and type a correction, changing "trangle" to "triangle".

1. Press **F11** once and you see that the debugger advances again.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on what type of code you edit in the debugger, you may see a warning message. In some scenarios, the code will need to recompile before you can continue.

## Step out

Let's say that you are done examining the `Draw` method in the `Triangle` class, and you want to get out of the function but stay in the debugger. You can do this using the **Step Out** command.

1. Press **Shift** + **F11** (or **Debug > Step Out**).

     This command resumes app execution (and advances the debugger) until the current function returns.

     You should be back in the `For Each` loop in the `Main` method.

## Restart your app quickly

Click the **Restart** ![Restart App](../../debugger/media/dbg-tour-restart.png "RestartApp") button in the Debug Toolbar (**Ctrl** + **Shift** + **F5**).

When you press **Restart**, it saves time versus stopping the app and restarting the debugger. The debugger pauses at the first breakpoint that is hit by executing code.

The debugger stops again at the breakpoint you set, on the `shape.Draw()` method.

## Inspect variables with data tips

Features that allow you to inspect variables are one of the most useful features of the debugger, and there are different ways to do it. Often, when you try to debug an issue, you are attempting to find out whether variables are storing the values that you expect them to have at a particular time.

1. While paused on the `shape.Draw()` method, hover over the `shapes` object and you see its default property value, the `Count` property.

1. Expand the `shapes` object to see all its properties, such as the first index of the array `[0]`, which has a value of `Rectangle`.

     ![View a data tip](../visual-basic/media/get-started-data-tip-vb.png "View a Data Tip")

    You can further expand objects to view their properties, such as the `Height` property of the rectangle.

    Often, when debugging, you want a quick way to check property values on objects, and the data tips are a good way to do it.

## Inspect variables with the Autos and Locals windows

1. Look at the **Autos** window at the bottom of the code editor.

     ![Inspect variables in the Autos Window](../visual-basic/media/get-started-autos-window-vb.png "Autos Window")

    In the **Autos** window, you see variables and their current value. The **Autos** window shows all variables used on the current line or the preceding line (Check documentation for language-specific behavior).

2. Next, look at the **Locals** window, in a tab next to the **Autos** window.

    The **Locals** window shows you the variables that are in the current [scope](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)), that is, the current execution context.

## Set a watch

1. In the main code editor window, right-click the `shapes` object and choose **Add Watch**.

    The **Watch** window opens at the bottom of the code editor. You can use a **Watch** window to specify a variable (or an expression) that you want to keep an eye on.

    Now, you have a watch set on the `shapes` object, and you can see its value change as you move through the debugger. Unlike the other variable windows, the **Watch** window always shows the variables that you are watching (they're grayed out when out of scope).

## Examine the call stack

1. While paused in the `For Each` loop, click the **Call Stack** window, which is by default open in the lower right pane.

2. Click **F11** a few times until you see the debugger pause in the `MyBase.Draw` method of the `Rectangle` class in the code editor. Look at the **Call Stack** window.

    ![Examine the call stack](../visual-basic/media/get-started-call-stack-vb.png "ExamineCallStack")

    The **Call Stack** window shows the order in which methods and functions are getting called. The top line shows the current function (the `Rectangle.Draw` method in this app). The second line shows that `Rectangle.Draw` was called from the `Main` function, and so on.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Call Stack** window is similar to the Debug perspective in some IDEs like Eclipse.

    The call stack is a good way to examine and understand the execution flow of an app.

    You can double-click a line of code to go look at that source code and that also changes the current scope being inspected by the debugger. This action does not advance the debugger.

    You can also use right-click menus from the **Call Stack** window to do other things. For example, you can insert breakpoints into specified functions, advance the debugger using **Run to Cursor**, and go examine source code. For more information, see [How to: Examine the Call Stack](../../debugger/how-to-use-the-call-stack-window.md).

## Change the execution flow

1. With the debugger paused in the `MyBase.Draw` method call of the `Rectangle` class, use the mouse to grab the yellow arrow (the execution pointer) on the left and move the yellow arrow up one line to the `Console.WriteLine` method call.

1. Press **F11**.

    The debugger reruns the `Console.WriteLine` method (you see duplicate output in the console window output).

    By changing the execution flow, you can do things like test different code execution paths or rerun code without restarting the debugger.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Often you need to be careful with this feature, and you see a warning in the tooltip. You may see other warnings, too. Moving the pointer cannot revert your application to an earlier app state.

1. Press **F5** to continue running the app.

    Congratulations on completing this tutorial!
