# How to: Install a Visualizer
After you have created a visualizer, you must install the visualizer so that it will be available in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. Installing a visualizer is a simple process.

> [!NOTE]
> In UWP apps, only the standard text, HTML, XML, and JSON visualizers are supported. Custom (user-created) visualizers are not supported.

### To install a visualizer

1. Locate the DLL that contains the visualizer you have built.

2. Copy the DLL to either of the following locations:

    - *VisualStudioInstallPath* `\Common7\Packages\Debugger\Visualizers`

    - `My Documents\` *VisualStudioVersion* `\Visualizers`

3. If you want to use a managed visualizer for remote debugging, copy the DLL to the same path on the remote computer.

4. Restart the debugging session.
