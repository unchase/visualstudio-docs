# Color theme tools
The Visual Studio SDK provides several tools to help you create and manage color themes.

- The [VSIX Color Editor](../../extensibility/internals/vsix-color-editor.md) tool can create and edit custom colors for Visual Studio.

- The [VSIX Color Compiler](../../extensibility/internals/vsix-color-compiler.md) tool converts existing Visual Studio theme *.xml* files into *.pkgdef* files for your extension.
