# How to: Build and run the LinqToXmlDataBinding example

This topic shows how to create and build the LinqToXmlDataBinding Visual Studio project, and how to run the resulting LinqToXmlDataBinding Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) example program.

For more information about Visual Studio, see [Visual Studio IDE overview](../get-started/visual-studio-ide.md).

## Create the project

1. Open Visual Studio and create a C# **WPF App** named **LinqToXmlDataBinding**.

   The project should target the .NET Framework 3.5 (or later).

1. If not already present, add project references for the following .NET assemblies:

    - System.Data

    - System.Data.DataSetExtensions

    - System.Xml

    - System.Xml.Linq

1. Build the solution by pressing **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**B**, then run it by pressing **F5**. The project should compile without errors and run as a generic WPF application.

## Add code to the project

1. In **Solution Explorer**, rename the source file **Window1.xaml** to **L2XDBForm.xaml**. The dependent source file **Window1.xaml.cs** should automatically be renamed to **L2XDBForm.xaml.cs**.

1. Replace the source code found in the file **L2XDBForm.xaml** with the code section from the topic [L2DBForm.xaml source code](../designers/l2dbform-xaml-source-code.md). Use the XAML source view to work with this file.

1. Similarly, replace the source in **L2XDBForm.xaml.cs** with the code found in [L2DBForm.xaml.cs source code](../designers/l2dbform-xaml-cs-source-code.md).

1. In the file **App.xaml**, replace all occurrences of the string `Window1.xaml` with `L2XDBForm.xaml`.

1. Build the solution by pressing **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**B**.

## Run the program

The LinqToXmlDataBinding program enables the user to view and manipulate a list of books that is stored as an embedded XML element.

### To run the program and view the book list

Run LinqToXmlDataBinding by pressing **F5** (**Start Debugging**) or **Ctrl**+**F5** (**Start Without Debugging**). A program window with the title **WPF Data Binding using LINQ to XML** appears.

- Notice the top section of the UI, which displays the raw **XML** that represents the book list. It is displayed using a WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control, which does not enable interaction through the mouse or keyboard.

- The second vertical section, labeled **Book List**, displays the books as a plain text ordered list. It uses a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control that enables selection though the mouse or keyboard.

### To add and delete books from the list

- To add a new book to the list, enter values into the **ID** and **Value**<xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls in the last section, **Add New Book**, then click the **Add Book** button. Note that the book is appended to the list in both the book and XML listings. This program does not validate input values.

- To delete an existing book from the list, select it in the **Book List** section, then click the **Remove Selected Book** button. Notice that the book entry has been removed from both the book and the raw XML source listings.

### To edit an existing book entry

1. Select the book entry in the second **Book List** section. Its current values should be displayed in the third section, **Edit Selected Book**.

1. Edit the values using the keyboard. As soon as either <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control looses focus, changes are automatically propagated to the XML source and book listings.
