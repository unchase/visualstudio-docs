# How to: Programmatically delete worksheets from workbooks
  You can delete any worksheet in a workbook. To delete a worksheet, use the worksheet host item or access the worksheet by using the sheets collection of the workbook.

 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_xlalldocapp](../vsto/includes/appliesto-xlalldocapp-md.md)]

## Use the worksheet host item
 If the worksheet was added at design-time in a document-level customization, use the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Delete%2A> method to delete a specified worksheet. The following code deletes a worksheet from a workbook by referencing the worksheet host item directly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code runs only in projects that you create by using any of the following project templates:
>
> - Excel 2013 Workbook
> - Excel 2013 Template
> - Excel 2010 Workbook
> - Excel 2010 Template
>
>   If you want to perform this task in any other type of project, you must add a reference to the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel** assembly, and then you must use classes from that assembly to open a workbook and delete a worksheet. For more information, see [How to: Target Office applications through primary interop assemblies](../vsto/how-to-target-office-applications-through-primary-interop-assemblies.md) and [Excel 2010 primary interop assembly reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=189585).

### To delete a worksheet by using a worksheet host item

1. Call the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.Worksheet.Delete%2A> method of `Sheet1`.

     [!code-csharp[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#17](../vsto/codesnippet/CSharp/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomationCS/Sheet1.cs#17)]
     [!code-vb[Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation#17](../vsto/codesnippet/VisualBasic/Trin_VstcoreExcelAutomation/Sheet1.vb#17)]

## Use the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook
 Access worksheets through the Microsoft Office Excel <xref:Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Sheets> collection in the following cases:

- You want to delete a worksheet in a VSTO Add-in.

- The worksheet that you want to delete was created at run time in a document-level customization.

  The following code deletes a worksheet from a workbook by referencing the sheet through the index number of the **Sheets** collection. This code assumes that a new worksheet was created programmatically.

### To delete a worksheet by using the Sheets collection of the Excel workbook
