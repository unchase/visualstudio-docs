# C26434 DONT_HIDE_METHODS

"Function hides a non-virtual function."

## C++ Core Guidelines

[C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of virtual, override, or final](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)

Introducing a function which has the same name as a non-virtual function in a base class is like introducing a variable name which conflicts with a name from outer scope. Furthermore, if signatures of functions mismatch, the intended overriding may turn into overloading. Overall, name hiding is dangerous and error-prone.

## Remarks

- Only non-overriding functions in current class are checked.
- Only non-virtual functions of base classes are considered.
- No signature matching is performed. Warnings are emitted if unqualified names match.
