# The RStudio Desktop benefit included in Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions

Take control of your R code.  RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. See more [RStudio features](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/features/).

RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux).  The RStudio Desktop benefit included in Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions includes one year of access to the commercial edition.
