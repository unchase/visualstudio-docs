# C6220
warning C6220 - Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: comparing HRESULT to -1. Consider using SUCCEEDED or FAILED macro instead

 This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being compared with an explicit, non-`HRESULT` value of -1, which is not a well-formed `HRESULT`. A failure in `HRESULT` (`E_FAIL`) is not represented by a -1. Therefore, an implicit cast of an `HRESULT` to an integer will generate an incorrect value and is likely to lead to the wrong result.

## Example
 In most cases, this warning is caused by the code mistakenly expecting that a function that should return an `HRESULT` instead returns an integer, by using -1 as a failure value. The following code sample generates this warning:

```
#include <windows.h>

HRESULT f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (hr == -1)
  {
    // failure code ...
    return E_FAIL;
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
}
```

 It is best to use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macro to test the value of an `HRESULT`. To correct this warning, use the following code:

```
#include <windows.h>

HRESULT f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  hr = CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc);
  if (FAILED(hr))
  {
    // failure code ...
    return E_FAIL;
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
    return S_OK;
  }
}
```

 For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

 Explicit comparison is appropriate to check for specific `HRESULT` values, such as, `E_FAIL`. Otherwise, use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macros.

 Note that the use of malloc and free (and related dynamic memory allocation APIs) have many pitfalls in terms of memory leaks and exceptions. To avoid these kinds of leaks and exception problems altogether, use the mechanisms that are provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). These include [shared_ptr](/cpp/standard-library/shared-ptr-class), [unique_ptr](/cpp/standard-library/unique-ptr-class), and [vector](/cpp/standard-library/vector).
