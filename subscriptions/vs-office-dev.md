# The Office 365 Developer subscription benefit in Visual Studio subscriptions

Subscribers with selected Visual Studio subscriptions receive the Office 365 Developer Subscription benefit.  The Office 365 Developer Subscription allows you to develop, test, and deploy add-ins for Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint.  This benefit allows for one tenant and up to 25 users.

## Activation steps

1. Visit [https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits?wt.mc_id=o~msft~docs) to sign in to the subscriber portal.

2. Depending on your account, you will either be redirected to your Organizationâ€™s sign-in page, or the Microsoft Account sign-in page.   In either case, please enter your username and password, and click **Next**.

3. Once the sign-in process is complete, you should see the Subscriptions Benefits page.  If you have more than one subscription, you can switch between the subscriptions by clicking the drop-down arrow in the top right corner, below the black ribbon.  The Office 365 Developer Subscription benefit tile is in the Tools category.  Use the arrow to the right of the row of tiles to scroll until the Office tile is visible.

4. Click on the **Activate** link at the bottom of the benefit tile.
