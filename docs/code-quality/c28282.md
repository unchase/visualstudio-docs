# C28282
warning C28282: Format Strings must be in preconditions

 This warning indicates that a `__drv_formatString` annotation is found, which is not in a `_Pre_` (`__drv_in`) annotation (function parameters are by default `_Pre_`). Check whether the annotation used in an explicit block with a `_Post_` (`__drv_out`) annotation. If so, remove the annotation from any enclosing block that has put it in a `_Post_` context.
