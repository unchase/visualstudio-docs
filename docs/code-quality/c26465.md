# C26465 NO_CONST_CAST_UNNECESSARY

Don't use `const_cast` to cast away `const`. `const_cast` is not required; constness or volatility is not being removed by this conversion. See [C++ Core Guidelines Type.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Pro-type-constcast).
