# C26464 USE_CONST_POINTER_FOR_ELEMENTS
  The values pointed to by elements of array '%array%' are assigned only once, mark elements as pointer to `const`. See [C++ Core Guidelines con.4](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#con4-use-const-to-define-objects-with-values-that-do-not-change-after-construction).
