# C28112

warning C28112: A variable which is accessed via an Interlocked function must always be accessed via an Interlocked function

See line *[number]*: It is not always safe to access a variable which is accessed via the Interlocked\* family of functions in any other way.

A variable that is accessed by using the Interlocked executive support routines, such as InterlockedCompareExchangeAcquire, is later accessed by using a different function. Although certain ordinary assignments, accesses, and comparisons to variables that are used by the Interlocked\* routines can be safely accessed by using a different function, the risk is great enough to justify examining each instance.

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:

```cpp
inter_var --;
...
InterlockedIncrement(&inter_var);
```

The following code example avoids this warning:

```cpp
InterlockedDecrement(&inter_var);
...
InterlockedIncrement(&inter_var);
```
