# C28219
warning C28219: Member of enumeration expected for annotation the parameter in the annotation

 A parameter to an annotation is expected to be a member of the named `enum` type, and some other symbol was encountered; use a member of that `enum` type. This usually indicates an incorrectly coded annotation macro.
