# Sample Excel Extension: ActionFilter Class
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This internal class extends the [UITestActionFilter](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2012/dd985757(v=vs.110)) class and represents a filter for test actions on a [!INCLUDE[ofprexcel](../includes/ofprexcel-md.md)] element.

## Simple Properties
 These read-only properties enable the developer to specify how this test action filter is to be executed by the coded UI testing framework. For example, the `UITestActionFilter.Name` property provides the name of the action filter. Other properties get the `UITestActionFilter.Category` of the action filter, the `UITestActionFilter.FilterType`, the `UITestActionFilter.Group` name for the test actions that are filtered by this test action filter. Others indicate whether to `UITestActionFilter.ApplyTimeout` and also whether the test action is `UITestActionFilter.Enabled`.

## ProcessRule Method
 This method is called by the coded UI testing framework, and executes the filter against the provided `IUITestActionStack`. This particular override removes a mouse choose action on a cell when the next action in the stack sends keystrokes to the cell. It then returns `false`.

## Private Methods
 The `IsLeftClick` method determines whether the provided action represents a left-click of the mouse. The `AreActionsOnSameExcelCell` method determines whether two provided actions are executed on the same cell in Excel.
