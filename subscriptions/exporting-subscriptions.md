# Export subscription information
In the Visual Studio Subscriptions [Administratration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), you can export a list of your subscribers and details about their assignments. This information includes their name, email address, alternate email address, subscription level, assigned date, activation status, expiration date, reference field, whether downloads are enabled, country, language, subscription status, and subscription GUID.  The list is exported as a CSV file, and can easily be opened in Microsoft Excel for the creation of charts, pivots and other artifacts.

Having all of your subscriber information in one place can help you do things like:
- Get an overall view of which subscriptions are in use by team and/or location across your organization.
- Develop plans and budgets for future subscription purchases. 
- Encourage users who have subscriptions assigned to activate.
- Take proactive action before subscriptions expire.  
- Identify where subscriptions may be overallocated. 

## Export your subscriptions
To perform the export:
1. Sign in to the [Administration Portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com).
2. Select the **Export** tab. and the file will download to your local machine. The file will include the name of the agreement that contains your user subscriptions, as well as the date of the export.
