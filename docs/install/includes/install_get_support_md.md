## Get support

Sometimes, things can go wrong. If your Visual Studio installation fails, see [Troubleshoot Visual Studio installation and upgrade issues](../troubleshooting-installation-issues.md) for step-by-step guidance.

We also offer a [**live chat**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/support/#talktous) (English only) support option for installation-related issues.

Here are a few more support options:

* Report product issues to us via the [Report a Problem](../../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md) tool that appears both in the Visual Studio Installer and in the Visual Studio IDE.
* Suggest a feature, track product issues, and find answers in the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/).
* Use your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to talk to us and other Visual Studio developers in the [Visual Studio conversation in the Gitter community](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/VisualStudio).
