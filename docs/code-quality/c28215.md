# C28215
warning C28215: The typefix cannot be applied to a parameter that already has a typefix

 Applying a `__typefix` annotation to a parameter that already has that annotation is an error. The `__typefix` annotations are used only in a few special cases and this warning is not expected to be seen in normal use.
