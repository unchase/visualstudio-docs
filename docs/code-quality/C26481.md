# C26481 NO_POINTER_ARITHMETIC
This check supports the rule *I.13: Do not pass an array as a single pointer*. Whenever raw pointers are used in arithmetic operations they should be replaced with safer kinds of buffers like `span<T>` or `vector<T>`.

## Remarks
- This check is a bit more restrictive than I.13: it doesnâ€™t skip zstring or czstring types.
- C26481 and C26485 come from the [Bounds Safety Profile](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md) rules implemented in the first release of the C++ Core Guidelines Checker. They are applicable to raw pointers category since they help to avoid unsafe use of raw pointers.
