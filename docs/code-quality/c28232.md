# C28232
warning C28232: \_Pre\_, \_Post\_, or \_Deref\_ not applied to any annotation

 This warning indicates that a `_Pre_`, `_Post_`, or `_Deref_` operator appears in an annotation expression without a subsequent functional annotation; the modifier was ignored, but this indicates an incorrectly coded annotation.
