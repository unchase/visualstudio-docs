# Globalizing and Localizing Applications
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

If you plan on distributing your application to an international audience, you'll need to keep several things in mind during the design and development phases. Even if you don't have such plans, a small effort up front can make things considerably easier should your plans change in future versions of your application. Services built into the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] make it easy to develop a single application that can adapt to different locales using managed development with Visual Studio.  
  
 Visual Studio was designed from the start to make developing for an international audience easy by taking advantage of services built into the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. The following pages will help introduce you to the internationalization features built into Visual Studio.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Introduction to International Applications Based on the .NET Framework](../ide/introduction-to-international-applications-based-on-the-dotnet-framework.md)  
 Introduces the concepts related to developing software for an international market using Visual Studio and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].  
  
 [Localizing Applications](../ide/localizing-applications.md)  
 Provides links to pages about customizing applications for a given culture.  
  
 [Globalizing Applications](../ide/globalizing-applications.md)  
 Provides links to pages about creating applications that support multiple cultures.
