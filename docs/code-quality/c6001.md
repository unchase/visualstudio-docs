# C6001
warning C6001: using uninitialized memory \<variable>

 This warning is reported when an uninitialized local variable is used before it is assigned a value. This could lead to unpredictable results. You should always initialize variables before use.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning because variable `i` is only initialized if `b` is true; otherwise an uninitialized `i` is returned:

```cpp
int f( bool b )
{
   int i;
   if ( b )
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   return i; // i is uninitialized if b is false
}
```

 To correct this warning, initialize the variable as shown in the following code:

```cpp
int f( bool b )
{
   int i= -1;

   if ( b )
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   return i;
}
```
