# Tutorial 3: Create a matching game

In this tutorial, you build a matching game, where the player must match pairs of hidden icons. You learn how to:

- Store objects, such as icons, in a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> object.

- Use a `foreach` loop in Visual C# or a `For Each` loop in Visual Basic to iterate through items in a list.

- Keep track of a form's state by using reference variables.

- Build an event handler to respond to events that you can use with multiple objects.

- Make a timer that counts down and then fires an event exactly once after being started.

When you finish this tutorial, your program will look like the following picture:
