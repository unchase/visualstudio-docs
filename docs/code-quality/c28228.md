warning C28228: Annotation parameter: cannot use type in annotations

 This warning indicates that a parameter is of type that is not supported. Annotations can only use a limited set of types as parameters. This should not be possible if the standard macros are being used for annotations; this warning is not expected to be seen in typical use.
