# Overview of code analysis for managed code in Visual Studio

Visual Studio can perform code analysis of managed code in two ways: with [legacy analysis](../code-quality/walkthrough-analyzing-managed-code-for-code-defects.md), also known as FxCop static analysis of managed assemblies, and with the more modern .NET Compiler Platform-based [code analyzers](../code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview.md). .NET Compiler Platform-based code analyzers, which analyze your code live as you type, replace legacy FxCop static code analysis, which only analyzes compiled code.
