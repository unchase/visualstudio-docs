# C26407 DONT_HEAP_ALLOCATE_UNNECESSARILY
To avoid unnecessary use of pointers we try to detect common patterns of local allocations, for example when the result of a call to operator new is stored in a local variable and later explicitly deleted. This supports the rule R.5: *Prefer scoped objects, don't heap-allocate unnecessarily*. The suggested fix is to use an RAII type instead of a raw pointer and allow it to deal with resources. If an allocation is a single object, then it may be obviously unnecessary and a local variable of the object’s type would work better.

## Remarks
- To reduce the number of warnings, this pattern is detected for owner pointers only. So, it is necessary to mark owners properly first. We can easily extend this to cover raw pointers if we receive feedback from customers in support of such scenario.
- The scoped object term may be a bit misleading, but the general idea is that we suggest using either a local variable whose lifetime is automatically managed, or a smart object which efficiently manages dynamic resources. Smart objects can of course do heap allocations, but it is not explicit in the code.
- If the warning fires on array allocation (which is usually needed for dynamic buffers), the fix can be to use standard containers, or `std::unique_pointer<T[]>`.
- The pattern is detected only for local variables, so we don’t warn on cases where an allocation is assigned to, say, a global variable and then deleted in the same function.

## Example 1: Unnecessary object allocation on heap

```cpp
auto tracer = new Tracer();
ScanObjects(tracer);
delete tracer;  // C26407
```

## Example 2: Unnecessary object allocation on heap (fixed with local object)

```cpp
Tracer tracer;  // OK
ScanObjects(&tracer);
```

## Example 3: Unnecessary buffer allocation on heap

```cpp
auto value = new char[maxValueSize];
if (ReadSetting(name, value, maxValueSize))
    CheckValue(value);
delete[] value; // C26407
```

## Example 4: Unnecessary buffer allocation on the heap (fixed with container)

```cpp
auto value = std::vector<char>(maxValueSize); // OK
if (ReadSetting(name, value.data(), maxValueSize))
    CheckValue(value.data());
```
