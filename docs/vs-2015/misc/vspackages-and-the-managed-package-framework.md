# VSPackages and the Managed Package Framework
You can reduce development time by creating a VSPackage with the managed package framework (MPF) classes instead of by using COM interop classes.  
  
 There are two ways to create a managed VSPackage:  
  
- Use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Package project template  
  
     For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Menu Command By Using the Visual Studio Package Template](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1985fa7d-aad4-4866-b356-a125b6a246de).  
  
- Build your VSPackage without the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Package project template  
  
     For example, you can copy a sample VSPackage and change the GUIDs and the names. You can find samples in the VSX section of [Code Gallery](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vsx/).
