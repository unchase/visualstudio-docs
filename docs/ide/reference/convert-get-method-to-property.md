# Convert Get method to property / Convert property to Get method refactorings

These refactorings apply to:

- C#

## Convert Get method to property

**What:** Lets you convert a Get method into a property (and optionally your Set method).

**When:** You have a Get method that does not contain any logic.

### How-to

1. Place your cursor in your Get method name.

1. Next, do one of the following:

   - **Keyboard**
      - Press **Ctrl**+**.** to trigger the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu, and select **Replace method with property** from the Preview window popup.
   - **Mouse**
      - Right-click the code, select the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu, and select **Replace method with property** from the Preview window popup.

1. (Optional) If you have a Set method, you can also convert your Set method at this time by selecting **Replace Get method and Set method with property**.

1. If you are happy with the change in the code preview, press **Enter** or click the fix from the menu and the changes will be committed.

Example:

```csharp
private int MyValue;

// Before
public int GetMyValue()
{
    return MyValue;
}

// Replace 'GetMyValue' with property

// After
public int MyValue
{
    get { return MyValue; }
}
```

   - **Keyboard**
      - Press **Ctrl**+**.** to trigger the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu and select **Replace property with methods** from the Preview window popup.

      - Right-click the code, select the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu and select **Replace property with methods** from the Preview window popup.
