# C26485 NO_ARRAY_TO_POINTER_DECAY
Like C26481, this check helps to enforce the rule I.13: *Do not pass an array as a single pointer* by detecting places where static array type information gets lost due to decay to a raw pointer. zstring and czstring types are not excluded.

## Remarks
C26481 and C26485 come from the [Bounds Safety Profile](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md) rules implemented in the first release of the C++ Core Guidelines Checker. They are applicable to raw pointers category since they help to avoid unsafe use of raw pointers.
