# Warning C26453: Arithmetic overflow: Left shift of a negative signed number is undefined behavior

This warning indicates we are left shifting a negative signed integral value, which is a bad idea  and triggers implementation defined behavior.

## Example

```cpp
void leftshift(int shiftCount)
{
  const auto result = -1 << shiftCount;  // C26453 reported here

  // code
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
void leftshift(int shiftCount)
{
  const auto result = ((unsigned)-1) << shiftCount; // OK

  // code
}
```
