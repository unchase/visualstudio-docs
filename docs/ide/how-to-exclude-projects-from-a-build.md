# How to: Exclude projects from a build

You can build a solution without building all projects that it contains. For example, you might exclude a project that breaks the build. You could then build the project after you investigate and address the issues.

You can exclude a project by taking the following approaches:

- Removing it temporarily from the active solution configuration.

- Creating a solution configuration that doesn't include the project.

For more information, see [Understand build configurations](../ide/understanding-build-configurations.md).

## To temporarily remove a project from the active solution configuration

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Configuration Manager**.

2. In the **Project contexts** table, locate the project you want to exclude from the build.

3. In the **Build** column for the project, clear the check box.

4. Choose the **Close** button, and then rebuild the solution.

## To create a solution configuration that excludes a project

1. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Configuration Manager**.

2. In the **Active solution configuration** list, choose **\<New>**.

3. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the solution configuration.

4. In the **Copy settings from** list, choose the solution configuration on which you want to base the new configuration (for example, **Debug**), and then choose the **OK** button.

5. In the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, clear the check box in the **Build** column for the project that you want to exclude, and then choose the **Close** button.

6. On the **Standard** toolbar, verify that the new solution configuration is the active configuration in the **Solution Configurations** box.

7. On the menu bar, choose **Build** > **Rebuild Solution**.
