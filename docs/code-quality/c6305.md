# C6305
warning C6305: potential mismatch between sizeof and countof quantities

 This warning indicates that a variable holding a `sizeof` result is being added to or subtracted from a pointer or `countof` expression. This will cause unexpected scaling in pointer arithmetic.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning:

```
void f(int *p)
{
  int cb=sizeof(int);
  //code...
  p +=cb; // warning 6305
}
```

 To correct this warning, use the following code:

```
void f(int *p)
{
  // code...
  p += 1;
}
```
