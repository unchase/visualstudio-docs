# C6276
warning C6276: Cast between semantically different string types: char* to wchar_t\*. Use of invalid string can lead to undefined behavior

 This warning indicates a potentially incorrect cast from an ANSI string (`char_t*`) to a UNICODE string (`wchar_t *`). Because UNICODE strings have a character size of 2 bytes, this cast might yield strings that are not correctly terminated. Using such strings with the wcs* library of functions could cause buffer overruns and access violations.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning:

```
#include <windows.h>
VOID f()
{
   WCHAR szBuffer[8];
   LPWSTR pSrc;

   pSrc = (LPWSTR)"a";
   wcscpy(szBuffer, pSrc);
}
```

 The following code corrects this warning by appending the letter L to represent the ASCII character as a wide character:

```
#include <windows.h>

VOID f()
{
   WCHAR szBuffer[8];
   LPWSTR pSrc;

   pSrc = L"a";
   wcscpy(szBuffer, pSrc);
}
```

 The following code uses the safe string manipulation function, `wcscpy_s`, to correct this warning:

```
#include <windows.h>

VOID f()
{
   WCHAR szBuffer[8];
   LPWSTR pSrc;
   pSrc = L"a";
   wcscpy_s(szBuffer,8,pSrc);
}
```
