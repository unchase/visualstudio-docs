# Collecting Application Statistics for Services by Using the Profiler Sampling Method
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

This section describes the procedures and options for collecting performance statistics for Windows services using the sampling method from the command line.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Performance Tools on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../profiling/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).
