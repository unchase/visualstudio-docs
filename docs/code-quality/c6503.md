# C6503
warning C6503: Invalid annotation: references and arrays may not be marked Null=Yes or Null=Maybe

> [!NOTE]
> This warning occurs only in code that is using a deprecated version of the source-code annotation language (SAL). We recommend that you port your code to use the latest version of SAL. For more information, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../code-quality/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-cpp-code-defects.md).

 This warning indicates that Null property is incorrectly used on a reference or array type. A reference or array type holds the address of an object and must point to a valid object. Because reference and array types cannot be null, you must correct the error by either removing the Null property or by setting the Null property value to No.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning:

```cpp
// C++
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>
using namespace vc_attributes;
class Point
{
public:
    //  members
};

void f([Pre(Null=Yes)] Point& pt);
```

 To correct this warning, set the Null property to No as shown in the following code:

```cpp
// C++
#include <CodeAnalysis\SourceAnnotations.h>
using namespace vc_attributes;

class Point
{
public:
    //  members
};
void f([Pre(Null=No)] Point& pt);
```
