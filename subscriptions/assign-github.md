# Manage Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise
Customers who have Enterprise Agreements (EA) with Microsoft are eligible to purchase a new subscription offer that brings together Visual Studio standard subscriptions and GitHub Enterprise. It's the easy and economical way for Visual Studio subscribers to acquire GitHub Enterprise. 

When your organization purchases Visual Studio Subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, they are provisioned and managed in two parts.

## Manage Visual Studio subscriptions
When your organization purchases Visual Studio Subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, the Visual Studio portion of the subscriptions is provisioned immediately and the subscriptions are available for assignment and management in the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Administration](https://manage.visualstudio.com) portal. 

For more information about managing subscriptions, check out these topics:
- [Using the Admin Portal](using-admin-portal.md)
- [Assign Subscriptions](assign-license.md)
- [Edit Subscriptions](edit-license.md)
- [Delete Subscriptions](delete-license.md)
- [Overallocations](handle-overclaimed-license.md)

> [!Important]
> If Visual Studio Subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise are assigned by Visual Studio subscription admins and there has never been a purchase of those subscriptions, they will not be visible to GitHub Enterprise admins within the organization. To ensure GitHub Enterprise subscriptions are visible, a purchase including **at least one** Visual Studio Professional with GitHub Enterprise or Visual Studio Enterprise with GitHub Enterprise subscription should be made the first time the subscriptions are assigned.  
>
> It is the customerâ€™s responsibility to ensure that for each GitHub subscription that is assigned there is a corresponding Visual Studio with GitHub subscription assigned in the Manage portal to remain in compliance with the licensing requirements for this subscription.

## Manage GitHub Enterprise subscriptions
When GitHub Enterprise subscriptions are purchased, GitHub partners with customers to help create and configure the organizations that will access GitHub and identify administrators.  Those administrators then receive a notification that they've been set up as admins.  

Since this process is more complex, it may take several days after subscriptions are purchased for the organizations and admins to be fully in set up.

GitHub is available as either the cloud-based GitHub.com, or on-premise GitHub Enterprise Server.  The processes for managing the two versions differ.  GitHub provides a variety of help topics and administrator guides to help you manage GitHub Enterprise subscriptions.  We've provided links to selected topics below.
