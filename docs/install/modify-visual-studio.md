# Modify Visual Studio by adding or removing workloads and components

::: moniker range="vs-2019"

It's easy to modify Visual Studio so that it includes only what you want, when you want it. To do so, open the Visual Studio Installer to add or remove workloads and components.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

Not only have we made it easier for you to personalize Visual Studio to match the tasks you want to accomplish, we've also made it easier to customize Visual Studio, too. To do so, start the new Visual Studio Installer and make the changes you want.

::: moniker-end

Here's how.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To install, update, or modify Visual Studio, you must log on with an account that has administrative permissions. For more information, see [User permissions and Visual Studio](../ide/user-permissions-and-visual-studio.md).

## Modify workloads

 [Workloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/visual-studio-workloads/) contain the features you need for the programming language or platform that you're using. Use workloads to modify Visual Studio so that it supports the work you want to do, when you want to do it.

>[!NOTE]
> The following procedure assumes that you have an internet connection.
>
> For more information about how to modify a previously created [offline installation](create-an-offline-installation-of-visual-studio.md) of Visual Studio, see both the [Update a network-based installation of Visual Studio](update-a-network-installation-of-visual-studio.md) page and the [Control updates to network-based Visual Studio deployments](controlling-updates-to-visual-studio-deployments.md) page.

1. Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10, select **Start**, and then scroll to the letter **V**, where it's listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

     ![Visual Studio Installer](media/vs2017-locate-the-visual-studio-installer.PNG "Locate the Microsoft Visual Studio Installer")

     >[!TIP]
     >On some computers, the Visual Studio Installer might be listed under the letter **"M"** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.<br/><br/> Alternatively, you can find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

1. Click or tap to start the installer, and then choose **Modify**.

     ![Launch or modify Visual Studio](media/modify-visual-studio.png "Modify Visual Studio 2017")

     If you have an update pending, the Modify button is in a different place. This way, you can modify Visual Studio without updating it, should you choose to do so. Click **More**, and then choose **Modify**.

     ![Update or modify Visual Studio](media/modify-or-update-visual-studio.png "Update or modify Visual Studio 2017")

1. From the **Workloads** screen, select or deselect the workloads that you want to install or uninstall.

    ![Visual Studio 2017 Setup Dialog](media/vs2017-modify-workloads.PNG "Choose a workload in Visual Studio 2017")

1. Choose **Modify** again.

1. After the new workloads and components are installed, choose **Launch**.

1. Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10, select **Start**, and then scroll to the letter **V**, where it's listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

     ![Open the Visual Studio Installer from Windows](media/vs-2019/vs-installer-windows-start.png "Open the Visual Studio Installer")

     > [!NOTE]
     > You can also find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location:
     >
     > `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

    You might have to update the installer before continuing. If so, follow the prompts.

1. In the installer, look for the edition of Visual Studio that you installed, and then choose **Modify**.

     ![Update or modify Visual Studio](media/vs-2019/vs-installer-modify.png "Update or modify Visual Studio 2019")

1. In the **Workloads** tab, select or deselect the workloads that you want to install or uninstall.

    ![Visual Studio 2019 setup dialog](media/vs-2019/vs-installer-modify-workloads.png "Choose a workload in Visual Studio 2019")

1. Choose whether you want to accept the default **Install while downloading** option or the **Download all, then install** option.

    ![Visual Studio 2019 setup options](media/vs-2019/vs-installer-choose-install-or-download.png "Choose to install while downloading or to download first and install later")

    The "Download all, then install" option is handy if you want to download first and then install later.

1. Choose **Modify**.

1. After the new workloads and components are installed, choose **Launch** from the Visual Studio Installer.

## Modify individual components

If you don't want to install [workloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/visual-studio-workloads/) to customize your Visual Studio installation, choose the **Individual Components** tab from the Visual Studio Installer, select what you want, and then follow the prompts.
