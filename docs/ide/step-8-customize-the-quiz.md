# Step 8: Customize the quiz

In the last part of the tutorial, you'll explore some ways to customize the quiz and expand on what you've already learned. For example, think about how the program creates random division problems for which the answer is never a fraction. To learn more, turn the `timeLabel` control a different color, and give the quiz taker a hint.

## To customize the quiz

- When only five seconds remain in a quiz, turn the **timeLabel** control red by setting its **BackColor** property.

  ```csharp
  timeLabel.BackColor = Color.Red;
  ```

  ```vb
  timeLabel.BackColor = Color.Red
  ```

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Use the programming language control at the top right of this page to view either the C# code snippet or the Visual Basic code snippet.<br><br>![Programming language control for Docs.Microsoft.com](../ide/media/docs-programming-language-control.png)

  Reset the color when the quiz is over.

- Give the quiz taker a hint by playing a sound when the correct answer is entered into a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> control. (You must write an event handler for each control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown.ValueChanged> event, which fires whenever the quiz taker changes the control's value.)
