# C6292
warning C6292: ill-defined for-loop: counts up from maximum

 This warning indicates that a for-loop might not function as intended.

 It occurs when a loop counts up from a maximum, but has a lower termination condition. This loop will terminate only after integer overflow occurs.

## Example
 The following code generates this warning:

```
void f( )
{
   int i;

   for (i = 100; i >= 0; i++)
   {
      // code ...
   }
}
```

 To correct this warning, use the following code:

```
void f( )
{
   int i;

  for (i = 100; i >= 0; i--)
   {
      // code ...
   }
}
```
