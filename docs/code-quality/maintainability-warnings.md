# Maintainability warnings

Maintainability warnings support library and application maintenance.

## In this section

| Rule | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| [CA1500: Variable names should not match field names](../code-quality/ca1500-variable-names-should-not-match-field-names.md) | An instance method declares a parameter or a local variable whose name matches an instance field of the declaring type, which leads to errors. |
| [CA1501: Avoid excessive inheritance](../code-quality/ca1501-avoid-excessive-inheritance.md) | A type is more than four levels deep in its inheritance hierarchy. Deeply nested type hierarchies can be difficult to follow, understand, and maintain. |
| [CA1502: Avoid excessive complexity](../code-quality/ca1502-avoid-excessive-complexity.md) | This rule measures the number of linearly independent paths through the method, which is determined by the number and complexity of conditional branches. |
| [CA1504: Review misleading field names](../code-quality/ca1504-review-misleading-field-names.md) | The name of an instance field starts with "s_", or the name of a static (Shared in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]) field starts with "m_". |
| [CA1505: Avoid unmaintainable code](../code-quality/ca1505-avoid-unmaintainable-code.md) | A type or method has a low maintainability index value. A low maintainability index indicates that a type or method is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate for redesign. |
| [CA1506: Avoid excessive class coupling](../code-quality/ca1506-avoid-excessive-class-coupling.md) | This rule measures class coupling by counting the number of unique type references that a type or method contains. |
| [CA1507: Use nameof in place of string](../code-quality/ca1507.md) | A string literal is used as an argument where a `nameof` expression could be used. |
