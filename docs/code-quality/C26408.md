# C26408 NO_MALLOC_FREE
This warning flags places where `malloc` or `free` is invoked explicitly in accordance to R.10: Avoid `malloc` and `free`. One potential fix for such warnings would be to use [std::make_unique](/cpp/standard-library/memory-functions#make_unique) to avoid explicit creation and destruction of objects. If such a fix is not acceptable, operator [new and delete](/cpp/cpp/new-and-delete-operators) should be preferred. In some cases, if exceptions are not welcome, `malloc` and `free` can be replaced with the nothrow version of operators `new` and `delete`.

## Remarks
- To detect malloc() we check if a call invokes a global function with name "malloc" or "std::malloc". The function must return a pointer to `void` and accept one parameter of unsigned integral type.
- To detect free() we check global functions with names "free" or "std::free" which return no result and accept one parameter, which is a pointer to `void`.
