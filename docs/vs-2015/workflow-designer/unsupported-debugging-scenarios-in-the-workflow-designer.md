# Unsupported debugging scenarios in the Workflow Designer
The Workflow Designer in [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] added many new features, but there are still some debugging scenarios that it does not support. This document details unsupported Workflow Designer debugging scenarios.  
  
- Execution cannot be continued after code has been edited.  
  
- Execution cannot be continued from an arbitrary point in the workflow (Set Next).  
  
- Execution cannot be continued until the cursor is reached (Run to Cursor).  
  
- The workflow designer cannot be used to debug workflows created in code without the use of the designer.  
  
- Workflows created in earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[wf](../includes/wf-md.md)] cannot be debugged in the [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] designer.  
  
- Breakpoints cannot be defined on links between activities or <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> nodes.  
  
- The clipboard is not available during debugging.  
  
- Breakpoints are not retained when activities are copied or pasted.  
  
- Workflow breakpoints cannot be set in the call stack window.  
  
- When creating breakpoints in the designer, the **Line** and **Character** settings in the **New Breakpoint** dialog are not used.  
  
- The Breakpoint window or shortcut menu does not support the following columns or options for workflow debugging:  
  
  - Condition  

  - Hit Count  

  - When Hit  

  - Function  

  - Data  

  - Process  

  - Go to Disassembly
