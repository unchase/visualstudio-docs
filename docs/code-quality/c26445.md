# C26445 NO_SPAN_REF
A reference to `gsl::span` or `std::string_view` may be an indication of a lifetime issue.
C++ Core Guidelines: [GSL.view: Views](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#gslview-views)

The intention of this rule is to catch subtle lifetime issues that may occur in code which has been migrated from standard containers to new span and view types. Such types can be considered as “references to buffers.” Using a reference to a span or view creates an additional layer of indirection. Such indirection is often unnecessary and can be confusing for maintainers. In addition, spans are cheap to copy and can be returned by value from function calls. Obviously, such call results should never be referenced.

## Remarks

- The rule detects references to gsl::span<>, gsl::basic_string_span<>, and std::basic_string_view<> (including aliases to instantiations).
- Currently warnings are emitted only on declarations and return statements. This may be extended in future to also flag function parameters.
- The implementation of this rule is very lightweight doesn’t attempt to trace actual lifetimes. Using of references may still make sense in some scenarios. In such cases, false positives can safely be suppressed.

## Example: Reference to a temporary

```cpp
// Old API - uses string reference to avoid data copy.
const std::string& get_working_directory() noexcept;

// New API – after migration to C++17 it uses string view.
std::string_view get_working_directory() noexcept;

// ...
// Client code which places an explicit reference in a declaration with auto specifier.
const auto &wd = get_working_directory(); // C26445 after API update.
```
