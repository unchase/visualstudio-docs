# Portability Warnings
Portability warnings support portability across different operating systems.

## In This Section

|Rule|Description|
|----------|-----------------|
|[CA1900: Value type fields should be portable](../code-quality/ca1900.md)|This rule checks that structures that are declared by using an explicit layout attribute will align correctly when marshaled to unmanaged code on 64-bit operating systems.|
|[CA1901: P/Invoke declarations should be portable](../code-quality/ca1901.md)|This rule evaluates the size of each parameter and the return value of a P/Invoke, and verifies that their size is correct when marshaled to unmanaged code on 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.|
|[CA1903: Use only API from targeted framework](../code-quality/ca1903.md)|A member or type is using a member or type that was introduced in a service pack that was not included together with the targeted framework of the project.|
