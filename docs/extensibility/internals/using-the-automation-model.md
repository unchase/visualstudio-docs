# Using the Automation Model
After you have connected your VSPackage to automation, you can obtain the properties and methods by calling the <xref:EnvDTE.DTEClass.GetObject%2A> method on the <xref:EnvDTE._DTE> object, passing a string representing the object you wish to retrieve.

## Obtaining Project Objects
 The following are two code examples that show how an automation consumer obtains the project automation objects. For information about how to get the DTE object, see [How to: Get References to the DTE and DTE2 Objects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/c92e3c8e-82e6-4a67-85da-e43c50ffd8e4).

```vb
Sub DoAutomation()
    Dim MyProjects As Projects
    MyProjects = DTE.GetObject("AcmeProject")
End Sub
```

```cpp
void DoAutomation(void)
{
  CComQIPtr<Projects> pMyPkg; // Use an IDispatch-derived object type.
    pMyPkg = pDTE->GetObject("AcmeProjects");

   // The '=' performs a Query Interface.
   // Assumes pDTE is already available as a global.
   // Use pMyPkg to access your projects object's properties and methods.
}

```

 At this point, you can use the standard project objects that are part of a specific VSPackage to move down the hierarchy model.

 The following code example shows how to get a custom object that is a property of a custom project type.:

```vb
Dim MyPrj As Project
Dim MyPrjItem As ProjectItem
Dim objMyObject as MyExtendedObject

MyPrj = MyProjects.Item(1) 'use the Projects collection to get a project
objMyObject = MyPrj.Object 'You call .Object to get to special Project
                           'implementation
objMyObject.MySpecialMethodOrProperty
```

 The following code lists the names of all of the properties in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] environment **General** option on the **Tools** menu:

```vb
dim objDTE
dim objEnv
set objDTE = CreateObject("VisualStudio.DTE")
set objEnv = objDTE.Properties("Environment", "General")
for each obj in ObjEnv
MsgBox obj.Name
Next

```
