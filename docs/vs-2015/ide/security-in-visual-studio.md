# Security in Visual Studio
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

You should consider security in all aspects of your application development, from design to deployment. Start by running Visual Studio as securely as possible. See [User Permissions](../ide/user-permissions-and-visual-studio.md).

 To help you effectively develop secure applications, you should have a fundamental understanding of security concepts and the security features of the platforms for which you develop. You should also understand secure coding techniques.

## Understanding Security
 [Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/9a9621d7-8883-4a4f-a874-65e8e09e20a6)
 Describes .NET Framework code access security, role-based security, security policy, and security tools.

## Coding for Security
 Most coding errors that result in security vulnerabilities occur because developers make incorrect assumptions when working with user input or because they don't fully understand the platform for which they're developing.

 [Secure Coding Guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4f882d94-262b-4494-b0a6-ba9ba1f5f177)
 Provides guidelines for classifying your components to address security issues.

 [Security Best Practices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/86acaccf-cdb4-4517-bd58-553618e3ec42)
 Discusses buffer overruns and the complete picture of the Microsoft Visual C++ security checks feature provided by the /GS compile-time flag.
