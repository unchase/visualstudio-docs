# VS Shell deployment
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

An isolated shell lets you determine which Visual Studio functionality you need to interact with your domain-specific language and how that solution should appear. For more information about the Visual Studio isolated shell, see [Customizing the Isolated Shell](../extensibility/customizing-the-isolated-shell.md). You can find more information about how to customize the isolated shell in [Customizing the Isolated Shell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/d75463cd-1155-42e4-8b7a-046ed6becbbf).  
  
### To set a Visual Studio Shell as the Deployment Target  
  
1. In the **DslPackage** project, open **source.extension.tt**.  
  
2. Under `<SupportedProducts>` insert:  
  
    ```  
    <IsolatedShell Version="1.0">MyIsolatedShell</IsolatedShell>  
    ```  
  
     Replace *MyIsolatedShell* with the name of your isolated shell package.
