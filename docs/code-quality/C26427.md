# C26427 NO_GLOBAL_INIT_EXTERNS

"Global initializer accesses extern object."

**C++ Core Guidelines**:
I.22: Avoid complex initialization of global objects

Global objects may be initialized in an inconsistent or undefined order, which means that interdependency between them is risky and should be avoided. This guideline is applicable when initializers refer to another object that's considered to be `extern`.

## Remarks

An object is deemed `extern` if it conforms to the following rules:

- it is a global variable marked with ‘extern’ specifier or it is a static member of a class;
- it is not in an anonymous namespace;
- it is not marked as ‘const’;
- Static class members are considered global, so their initializers are also checked.

## Example

external version check
// api.cpp

```cpp
int api_version = API_DEFAULT_VERSION; // Assume it can change at run time, hence non-const.

// client.cpp
extern int api_version;
bool is_legacy_mode = api_version <= API_LEGACY_VERSION; // C26427, also stale value
```

external version check – made more reliable

```cpp
// api.cpp
int api_version = API_DEFAULT_VERSION; // Assume it can change at run time, hence non-const.

// client.cpp
extern int api_version;
bool is_legacy_mode() noexcept
{
    return api_version <= API_LEGACY_VERSION;
}
```
