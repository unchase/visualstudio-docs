# Regex completion through IntelliSense menu

This refactoring applies to:

- C#

**What:** Regular expression (regex) completion through IntelliSense menu.

**When:** You want to write a regular expression with help from IntelliSense. IntelliSense gives you basic completion and an explanation as to what each of the regex characters mean. 

**Why:** Writing regex is hard and IntelliSense can help you write it.

## How-to

1. Place your cursor in the regex string.
2. Press **Ctrl**+**Space** to trigger the **IntelliSense** menu.
3. Select the character you would like to add to your regex string.
