# C6328

Warning C6328: Size mismatch: \<type> passed as parameter \<number> when \<type> is required in call to \<function>

Passing an argument of type `char` to C runtime, character-based routines named `is<xxx>()`, for example, `isspace()`, can have unpredictable results. For example, an SBCS or MBCS single-byte character of type `char` with a value greater than `0x7F` is a negative value. If a `char` is passed, the compiler might convert the value to a signed `int` or a signed `long`. This value could be sign-extended by the compiler, with unexpected results. For example, `isspace` accepts an argument of type `int`; however, the valid range of values for its input argument is:

`0 <= c <= 255`, plus the special value `EOF`.

## Example

By default, `char` is a signed type in Visual C++, so the range of values of a variable of type char is `-128 <= c <= 127`. Therefore, if you did the following, `c` would be sign-extended to a signed `int` with a value of -37, which is outside the valid range for [isspace](/cpp/standard-library/locale-functions#isspace):

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void f( )
{
    char c = -37;
    int retVal = isspace( c );
    // code ...
}
```

To correct this problem, you can use `static_cast`, as shown in the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void f( )
{
    char c = -37;
    int retVal = isspace( static_cast<unsigned char> (c) );
    // code ...
}
```

Warning C6328 exists specifically to catch this bug. For characters in the 7-bit ASCII range, the cast is unnecessary. Characters outside that range can have unpredictable results, for example, program fault and termination.
