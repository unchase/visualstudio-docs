# Tutorial 2: Create a Timed Math Quiz
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../includes/vs2017banner.md)]

In this tutorial, you build a quiz in which the quiz taker must answer four random arithmetic problems within a specified time. You learn how to:  
  
- Generate random numbers by using the `Random` class.  
  
- Trigger events to occur at a specific time by using a **Timer** control.  
  
- Control program flow by using `if else` statements.  
  
- Perform basic arithmetic operations in code.  
  
  When you finish, your quiz will look like the following picture, except with different numbers.
