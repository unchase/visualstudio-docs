# C26447 DONT_THROW_IN_NOEXCEPT

The function is declared **noexcept** but calls a function that may throw exceptions.

C++ Core Guidelines:
[F.6: If your function may not throw, declare it noexcept](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#f6-if-your-function-may-not-throw-declare-it-noexcept).

This rule amends another rule, [C26440 DECLARE_NOEXCEPT](c26440.md), which tries to find functions that are good candidates to be marked as **noexcept**. In this case, the idea is that once some function is marked as **noexcept**, it must keep its contract by not invoking other code that may throw exceptions.

- The Microsoft C++ compiler already handles straightforward violations like **throw** statements in the function body (see [C4297](/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4297)).
- The rule focuses only on function calls. It flags targets that are not **constexpr** and that can potentially throw exceptions; in other words they are not marked explicitly as non-throwing by using **noexcept**, **__declspec(nothrow)**, **throw()**.
- The compiler-generated target functions are skipped to reduce noise since exception specifications are not always provided by the compiler.
- The checker also skips special kinds of target functions that are expected to be implemented as **noexcept**; this rule is enforced by [C26439 SPECIAL_NOEXCEPT](c26439.md).
