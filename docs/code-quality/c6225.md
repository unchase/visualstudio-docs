# C6225

warning C6225: Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: assigning 1 or TRUE to HRESULT. Consider using S_FALSE instead

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being assigned or initialized with a value of an explicit 1. Boolean types indicate success by a non-zero value; success (`S_OK`) in `HRESULT` is indicated by a value of 0. This warning is frequently caused by accidental confusion of Boolean and `HRESULT` types. To indicate success, the symbolic constant `S_OK` should be used.

## Example

In the following code, assignment of `HRESULT` generates this warning:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

VOID f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  if (SUCCEEDED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))
  {
    // code ...
    hr = S_OK;
  }
  else
  {
    // code ...
    hr = 1;
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, use the following code:

```cpp
VOID f( )
{
  HRESULT hr;
  LPMALLOC pMalloc;

  if (SUCCEEDED(CoGetMalloc(1, &pMalloc)))
  {
    hr = S_OK;
    // code ...
  }
  else
  {
    hr = S_FALSE;
    // code ...
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

To indicate failure, `E_FAIL`, or another constant, should be used.
